# Print Clean chrome extension

helps to print from different websites.

For now it only supports united.com ticket confirmation page, and gmail email page or gmail print email page.

Use cases:

1. Sometimes you need to print email content from Gmail, but gmail always appends the header to it with logo and from and to etc.
this plugin removes that header.

2. united airlines - if you open your confirmation page and you want to print it. it adds all sorts of stuff there. like links to signup for some bonus programs. which are not needed on paper.

I'll be adding more use cases as needed.


plugin support configuration/options.
for now it only takes a list of css selectors to hide.
e.g (headers, banners etc) which works for united.com.

however for gmail there is a custom script that keeps only certain content.
